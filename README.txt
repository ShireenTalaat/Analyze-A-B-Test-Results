Introduction
A/B tests are very commonly performed by data analysts and data scientists.

For this project, I will be working to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. 
The goal is to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should implement the new page, 
keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

Conclusion:
Based on the previous analysis it is noticed that there is no significant effect on the convertion based on the country.

There is not enough evidence that (new page) increases the conversion rate compared to (old_page).

The company should keep the old page.
